<h1 id="modeling-of-cylindrically-symmetric-non-paraxial-beams">Modeling
of cylindrically symmetric non-paraxial beams</h1>
<p>In the previous sections, I have shown the plane-wave expansions in
multipoles for both of the approaches for comparison. In real scattering
experiments, one often works with waves that are cylindrically symmetric
and not plane. These are beams that are more complicated, as they can be
decomposed into <em>many</em> plane waves<span class="citation"
data-cites="xavi">[@xavi]</span>. This section will describe how to
model a monochromatic, non-paraxial, and cylindrically symmetric beam
with a well-defined helicity using the <em>aplanatic lens model</em>,
which is explained both in <span class="citation"
data-cites="nanooptics">[@nanooptics]</span> and <span class="citation"
data-cites="xavi">[@xavi]</span>. Then, a brief description of the
implementation will be given along with different visualisations of the
fields.</p>
<h2 id="the-aplanatic-lens-model">The aplanatic lens model</h2>
<p>The idea of the aplanatic lens model is to describe a focused beam as
a transformation by a lens of an incident beam. In later chapters, a
scattering sphere will be placed in the focal point of this lens, <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, making the model quite realistic. The
focusing is illustrated in Fig. <a href="#fig:aplanatic"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:aplanatic">1</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>I will not go through the derivation of the expression for the
focused field in great detail, but only lay out the overall steps.<br />
The model assumes the so-called sine condition, which states that the
refraction by the aplanatic lens is equivalent to that of a perfect
sphere with radius <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Additionally,
conservation of intensity is assumed during refraction. <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{E}_{inc}\)</span> is then transformed from
cylindrical coordinates into spherical after the lens. Some
simplifications are made to ensure the conservation of helicity <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and angular momentum <span
class="math inline">\(J_z\)</span>. This is important, as one can then
define an incident field and be certain that its important parameters
are still conserved after focusing (helicity <span
class="math inline">\(p=1\)</span> will be used in this study).<br />
The focused field, which naturally depends on the expression of the
incident field, can be expressed as an expansion in multipoles. In <span
class="citation" data-cites="xavi">[@xavi]</span>, the multipolar
decomposition of a Laguerre-Gaussian beam is provided. The modes of such
a beam, <span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{LG}_l^q\)</span>, are
cylindrically symmetric solutions of the paraxial equation. <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span>, the so-called radial index, is assumed
to be 0 throughout this report, while <span class="math inline">\(l\in
\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, which is related to the AM content, will be
varied.<br />
When focused by an aplanatic lens, an electric field containing LG modes
becomes a solution of not only the paraxial equation but also Maxwellâ€™s
equations<span class="citation" data-cites="xavi">[@xavi]</span>. Such a
field with a single LG mode has the expression <span
class="math display">\[\label{eq:Efoc}
    \mathbf{E}_{foc}=\sum_{j=\abs{m_z}}^\infty
i^j\sqrt{2j+1}C_{jm_zp}\left[
    \mathbf{A}_{jm_z}^{(m)}+ip\mathbf{A}_{jm_z}^{(e)}\right]\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(m_z=l+p\)</span>. The linear
combination of the multipoles in the brackets is a multipole with a
well-defined helicity, which will be used later. Note that the lowest
multipolar order is <span class="math inline">\(\abs{m_z}\)</span>.
<span class="math inline">\(C_{jm_zp}\)</span>, the coefficient whose
absolute value squared describes the content of each multipole in the
expansion, is given by the following expression: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:C_foc}
    C_{jm_zp}&amp;=\frac{f\mathrm{e}^{-ikf}}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{n_1}{n_2}}\cdot\\&amp;\int_0^{\theta_k^{m}}
    \d\theta_k\sin\theta_k\sqrt{\cos\theta_k}d^j_{m_zp}(\theta_k)N_l^q
    \mathrm{exp}\left[-\frac{(f\sin\theta_k)^2}{w^2}
    \right](f\sin\theta_k)^l L_q^l\left(\frac{2(f\sin\theta_k)^2}{w^2}
    \right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{w}\right)^{l+1}
\end{aligned}\]</span> The integral is carried out over <span
class="math inline">\(\theta_k\)</span>, a momentum-space representation
of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. This range is defined by
the numerical aperture (NA) of the lens. Everything from <span
class="math inline">\(N_l^q\)</span> and after is the expression of the
<span class="math inline">\(\mathrm{LG}\)</span>-mode with a waist <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, also including a generalized Laguerre
polynomial. <span class="math inline">\(N_l^q\)</span> is a
normalisation factor, and <span
class="math inline">\(d^j_{m_zp}(\theta_k)\)</span> is the reduced
Wigner rotation matrix - a neat transformation that ensures that the
scalar wave functions are always eigenstates of <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbf{J}^2\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(J_z\)</span>.</p>

focused z-propagating LG beams for different lens and beam parameters.
XY slices correspond to a transverse slice of the beam. The XZ slices
show the beam along its direction of propagation.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Examples of focused beams are shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:Efoc"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:Efoc">6</a> for two values
of NA. Clearly, higher NA gives a tighter focus, judging by the spot
sizes for the <span class="math inline">\(l=0\)</span> cases and the
curvatures for <span class="math inline">\(l=2\)</span>. An interesting
feature is that when <span class="math inline">\(l=0\)</span>, the LG
beam corresponds to a Gaussian beam, having highest intensity in the
center. For <span class="math inline">\(l&gt;0\)</span>, the beam is
toroidal with no intensity in the center. An important point is that one
can in principle vary the beam waist independently of the NA and <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span>. However, since <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> affects the beam shape and the NA
essentially dictates the size of the lens, I have chosen <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> such that the beam always spans the
entire lens but never exceeds it (which would mean that the beam was cut
off).</p>
<p>Another interesting study is the multipolar content of the beams,
i.e. the modal distribution in the expansions. This will be important
later on, since the multipolar content directly impacts the modes
excited during scattering.<br />
For NA=<span class="math inline">\(0.5\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(0.9\)</span>, the multipolar content, <span
class="math inline">\(\abs{C_{jm_zp}}^2\)</span>, is plotted for
incident beams with values <span class="math inline">\(l=0, 2,
4\)</span> and 6 in Fig. <a href="#fig:mcontent"
data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="fig:mcontent">11</a>. Note
that there are no multipoles of order <span
class="math inline">\(j&lt;l+p\)</span>. It is clearly seen that the
more tightly focused light (NA=0.9) contains fewer, lower-ordered
multipoles. As <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> increases, both
distributions shift to higher order and become broader. A tendency
toward a symmetric bell-curve is seen, especially for NA=0.5.<br />
Since one rarely works with dry microscope objectives with NA<span
class="math inline">\(&gt;0.9\)</span>, that is not investigated. In any
case, it is impossible to obtain a tightly focused LG beam composed of a
single multipole.</p>
